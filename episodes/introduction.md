This course provides an in-depth look at the cloud data management principles applied in the QESD Platform. The following sections provide an overview:

1. **Physical and Logical Representation of Data**: This refers to the system's ability to store actual files within a storage account and logically represent them in a viewing platform such as Synapse.

2.** Data Layers and Containers**: The platform uses data layers and containers to organise databases based on the level of transformation they have undergone after ingestion from their original format.

3. **Working Environments**: Four working environments, namely development, testing, production and exceptions have been designed to cater to different user needs and activities.

4. **The QESD Platform as a Data Lake**: The platform has been designed as a data lake, being able to hold raw data in its native format and integrate datasets with analysis and machine learning tools.

5. **End-to-End Example with Tide Data from Open Data**: This section provides an illustration of the entire process of data management in the platform using the Cairns tide gauge data sets from Open Data as an example - from data gathering and consolidation, transformation to required formats, to views for analysis purposes.
