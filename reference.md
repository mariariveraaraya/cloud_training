## Glossary

Physical Storage: Refers to the actual files stored in a storage account within the data lake. It represents the raw, native format of the data.
Logical Representation: Refers to the view or representation of data that can be accessed in platforms like Synapse. It may involve transformations, cleaning rules, and additional columns added to the raw data.
Data Layers: Organizational levels or stages within a data lake that represent different levels of transformation and refinement that data has undergone. Each data layer contains data at a specific level of processing readiness.
Schemas: Logical structures or blueprints that define the organization and format of data within each data layer. They specify the tables, columns, and relationships present in the data.
Resource Groups: Organizational units in the platform that group and manage related resources together. They help organize access and permissions within the platform.
Permissions: Determine the level of access and control users have over resources within the platform. It can include read-only access or the ability to contribute or write data back to storage.
Environments: Different developmental or operational settings within the platform that are used for specific activities or purposes. For example, development, testing, and production environments may be available.
Synapse Queries: Queries written and executed in Synapse to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data. It involves using SQL scripts or Transact-SQL to interact with the data.
Automated Documentation: Documentation views automatically generated within Synapse that provide descriptions for data objects, tables, and views. They help users understand the structure and attributes of the data.
Power BI: A business intelligence tool used for data analysis and visualization. It connects to data sources like Synapse to create interactive reports and dashboards.
Databricks: A unified analytics platform that allows users to perform data engineering, data science, and data analysis tasks. It can be integrated with Synapse for processing and analyzing data.
Data Lake: A large-scale storage repository that holds structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in its original format. It enables the storage and processing of vast amounts of data for analysis and exploration.
Data Frames: A data structure used in Databricks and other analytics tools that organizes data into rows and columns. It supports various operations and transformations for data manipulation and analysis.
Data Lake Layers: Refers to the different stages or levels of data transformation within a data lake. These layers represent different levels of data refinement and preparation for analysis.
Curated View: A logical representation or view of data that has undergone cleaning, wrangling, and curation in the data lake. It represents the transformed and refined version of the data.
Azure: A cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft that offers a variety of services and resources for data storage, processing, and analysis.
